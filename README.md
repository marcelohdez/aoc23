# Advent of Code 2023

Decided to learn some C, make fun of my code and Makefile all you want (I need
it.)

## Building/Running

_(Only tested on Linux/Unix-like systems)_

Firstly, input files are expected for each day, specifically named as
`./day-$NUM/input.txt` e.g. for day 1, `./day-1/input.txt` should exist before
attempting to run it.

Run `make` from this project's root and you will be asked for the **number**
of day you would like to compile. After succeeding, a binary will be placed at
`./build/out`, you could then run it directly, or to do so automatically you
may run `make run` and enter the number of day wanted.
